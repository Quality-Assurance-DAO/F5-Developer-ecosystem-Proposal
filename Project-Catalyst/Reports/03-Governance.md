## 03-Governance

Holding Page

This deliverable will be a "leap of faith" interaction with voters to assess whether QA-DAO should be funded $5 given the delivery of 80% of outputs (1 -5).

The Governance of this proposal will transfer to the QA-DAO Open Source Repository (https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/DAO-Open-Source). This is already active in conducting a study of OccamFi's OCC token launch and will be supplemented by output documents from this Fund 5 proposal.
