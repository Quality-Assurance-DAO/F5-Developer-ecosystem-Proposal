A) The Open-Source DAO.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A1) DAO-Open Source. The aim of the QA-DAO is to apply existing best practice open-source community standards and methods to all Catalyst Projects.
The QA-DAO project has commenced with a GitHub organization. Our members are open-source partners from the Catalyst community working with our repository maintainer Stephen Whitenstall https://stephen-rowan.github.io/ to implement this proposal's open-source aims and our collaborators are the wider open-source community.
A2) Open Source - QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process.
QA-DAO has begun to pursue its quality assessment objectives with an assessment of to what degree the Catalyst Funding Process is open source.
Our contribution is FeedbackChallenge : Open Source https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal/issues/32 which is running during Fund 5's Refine and Finalise stages.
