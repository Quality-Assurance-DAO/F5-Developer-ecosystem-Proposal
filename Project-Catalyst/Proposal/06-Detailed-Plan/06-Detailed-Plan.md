## A Open-Source - The DAO.

The aim of the QA-DAO is to apply existing best practice open-source community standards and methods to all Catalyst Projects. 

The QA-DAO project has commenced with a GitHub organization, our members are open-source partners from the Catalyst community working with the repository maintainer to implement this proposal's open-source aims and our collaborators are the wider open-source community.

## B Open Source - QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process.

QA-DAO has begun to pursue its quality assessment objectives with an assessment of to what degree the Catalyst Funding Process is open source.

Our contribution is **FeedbackChallenge : Open Source** (https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal/issues/32) which is running during **Fund 5's Refine and Finalise stages**.

## C Project Management: DAO-Peer-Facilitation

**DAO-Peer-Facilitation** (a Distributed Peer Facilitation repository) is currently being prepared which will address the reform of Project Management from top-down planning to distributed peer facilitation and empowerment models.

## D Project Management: QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process.

A QA assessment of how the Catalyst Funding Process can be reoriented from top-down planning to distributed peer facilitation and empowerment models is planned.

## E Maturity-Models: DAO-Maturity-Model

**DAO-Maturity-Model**: A repository adapting Quality Assurance Maturity-Models to progress distributed autonomous organisation (DAO) to Institutional Audit Standards is currently being prepared.

## F Maturity-Models: QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process

A QA assessment of where the Catalyst Funding Process fits in the Blockchain Maturity Model and whether Catalyst can progress DAOs to Institutional Audit Standards is planned.

**Estimated cost**: 2 ADA to mint an ADA Non-Fungible Token that records the support of Project Catalyst for QA-DAO. Set to $5 to cover currency value changes.

**Token Rewards** - A process outlining a means to reward community contributions has been drafted for NFT-DAO and released under a Creative Common License (https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/DAO-Open-Source/blob/main/Documents/Tokens/Keep-It-Simple.md)
