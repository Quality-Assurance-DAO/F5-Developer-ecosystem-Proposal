A) The Open-Source DAO. Fund 5.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A1) DAO-Open Source. The aim of the QA-DAO is to encourage collaboration and innovation across all open-source Catalyst Projects. The QA-DAO project started with a GitHub organization, the repository maintainer Stephen Whitenstall https://stephen-rowan.github.io/ hopes to work with open-source projects in the Catalyst community, to gain an understanding of our context and extend our reach to collaborators in the wider open-source community. QA-DAO's approach is iterative, recording lessons learnt from the proposal process for the community and adopting improvements from constructive criticism where they apply to a broad base.

This contribution is FeedbackChallenge : Open Source https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal/issues/32 which is running during Fund 5's Refine and Finalise stages.
