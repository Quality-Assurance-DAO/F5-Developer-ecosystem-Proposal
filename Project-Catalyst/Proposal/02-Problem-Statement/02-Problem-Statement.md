# 02-Problem-Statement (140 char. limit)

On Cardano there is no clear guidance on Open Source, a lack of Quality Assurance methods or standards & Centralized Project Management.


## Challenge

1. To prioritize open and accessible development tools and methods.
1. Attract developers from outside of our current community by appealing to the wider open-source base.
1. Provide developers with a Quality Assurance resource integrated with the Cardano dev ecosystem.
1. Motivate engagement with documentation and processes through participation from the outset.
1. Build Cardano systems to maturity level standards that can pass audit and be open to government contracts.

## Desired outcome: 
> This paints a picture of the ideal set of circumstances once your solution is accepted.

1. An open-source, generic, Quality Assurance organisation.
1. Generic to all Catalyst Projects and Platforms and the wider community.
3. Community recognition and adoption of open source.
4. Community recognition and adoption of the distributed, autonomous organization of Quality Assurance.
5. Commence Quality Assurance assessments from the outset, including the proposal process itself.

## Blocking problem: 
> A concise explanation of the problem preventing this set of circumstances from occurring.

1. Institutional resistance to open source
1. Ideascale's use of proprietary platforms

## Costs of the problem: 
> A summation of both the opportunity and financial costs of the problem to key stakeholders. This helps voters assess how much impact the problem has.

1. The cost of proprietary platforms
1. The cost of contracted Quality Assurance and Project Management Resources

## Evidence:
> Support for your position laid out in a detailed plan.
1. Evidence is sought from Project Catalyst on the cost of its use of proprietary (not open-source) platforms and contracted Quality Assurance and Project Management Resources to date and going forward.
