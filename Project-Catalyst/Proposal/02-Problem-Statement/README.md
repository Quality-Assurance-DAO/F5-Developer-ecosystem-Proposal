# 02-Problem-Statement README

## Challenge

1. To prioritize open and accessible development tools and methods.
1. Attract developers from outside of our current community by appealing to the wider open-source base.
1. Provide developers with a Quality Assurance resource integrated with the Cardano dev ecosystem.
1. Motivate engagement with documentation and processes through participation from the outset.
1. Build Cardano systems to maturity level standards that can pass audit and be open to government contracts.

## Desired outcome: 
> This paints a picture of the ideal set of circumstances once your solution is accepted.

1. An open-source, generic, Quality Assurance organisation.
1. Generic to all Catalyst Projects and Platforms and the wider community.
3. Community recognition and adoption of open source.
4. Community recognition and adoption of the distributed, autonomous organization of Quality Assurance.
5. Commence Quality Assurance assessments from the outset, including the proposal process itself.

## Blocking problem: 
> A concise explanation of the problem preventing this set of circumstances from occurring.

1. Institutional resistance to open source
1. Ideascale's use of proprietary platforms

## Costs of the problem: 
> A summation of both the opportunity and financial costs of the problem to key stakeholders. This helps voters assess how much impact the problem has.

1. The cost of proprietary platforms
1. The cost of contracted Quality Assurance and Project Management Resources

## Evidence:
> Support for your position laid out in a detailed plan.
1. Evidence is sought from Project Catalyst on the cost of its use of proprietary (not open-source) platforms and contracted Quality Assurance and Project Management Resources to date and going forward.



## Project Catalyst guidance

> Project Catalyst provides the follwoing guidance in respect of completing a Problem Statemennt for Fund 5 Propsals ([Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oE_cnP0gksdAanXV4w5DYaDNp_tbYEvyHhTUG4HYZ3Q/edit))

### How to write a problem statement (140 cahr. limit).

### Rising to the challenge

Each fund will have a specific challenge which proposals will attempt to solve. Challenges will originally be set by the Project Catalyst team and then opportunities will arise for the community to develop their own. It is crucial that proposals address the challenge directly. Here is an example of a challenge and some problem statements which address it.

### Challenge

How can we encourage developers and entrepreneurs to build Dapps and businesses on top of Cardano in the next 6 months?

### Problem statements

Builders don’t want to deal with the red tape\time cost of securing funding. How do we help Cardano builders streamline proposals?

I am trying to solve the problem of bootstrapping decentralized\open finance movement on Cardano before Plutus and Marlowe hit mainnet.

In both of these examples the relationship between the problem statements and the challenge is apparent. This is what voters will be looking for. However, while the content of the problem statements is clear and effective, these problem statements can be improved.

### Making great problem statements (140 char. limit)

The problem statement identifies the issue related to the challenge, and offers a solution. It is important to focus on common problems, urgent problems, expensive problems, and frequent problems. Explaining your problem in these terms is crucial to a good proposal so it should be the first thing seen by voters. A good problem statement has four components: the desired outcome, blocking problem, costs of the problem, and the evidence.

### Structure of the problem statement

1. **Desired outcome:** This paints a picture of the ideal set of circumstances once your solution is accepted.
1. **Blocking problem:** A concise explanation of the problem preventing this set of circumstances from occurring.
1. **Costs of the problem:** A summation of both the opportunity and financial costs of the problem to key stakeholders. This helps voters assess how much impact the problem has.
1. **Evidence:** Support for your position laid out in a detailed plan.

Here’s an example:

**Desired Outcome**

> We want to make it affordable to transfer money to workers living in the Philippines. 

**Blocking problem**

> 11% of the population of the Philippines lose money on transaction fees.

**Costs of the problem**

> Around $1 billion is paid in transfer fees annually.

**Evidence**

> Link (s) to data which proves this.

Here’s the complete problem statement which condenses the information above:

> “Money transfer to Philippines workers should be affordable. However, 11% of the population are losing 1B$ in transaction fees per year. Research links [1],[2]“

### In conclusion

State your desired outcome and the problem blocking it

1. Define the cost of the problem
1. Give evidence for your findings
