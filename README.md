## A) The Open-Source DAO. Fund 5.

**A1) DAO-Open Source.** The aim of the QA-DAO is to encourage collaboration and innovation across all open-source Catalyst Projects. The QA-DAO project started with a GitHub organization, the repository maintainer **Stephen Whitenstall** https://stephen-rowan.github.io/ seeks to work with open-source projects in the Catalyst community, to gain an understanding of their context and to extend their reach to collaborators in the wider open-source community. QA-DAO's approach is iterative, recording lessons learnt from the proposal process for the community and adopting improvements from constructive criticism where they apply to a broad base.

**A2) Catalyst Open Source - QA Assessment of Catalyst Proposal Process.**
QA-DAO has begun with an experimental assessment of the various open-source perspectives within this Catalyst Fund 5 Process. This contribution is **FeedbackChallenge : Open Source** : https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal/issues/32 which will run during Fund 5's Refine and Finalise stages (to gather Issues on the Proposal Process itself) and then continue onto Fund 5's Review and Assess stages (to gather issues on the Review Process).

## B) Project Management: The DAO of Peer-Facilitation - Fund 7

**B1) DAO-Peer-Facilitation (a Distributed Peer Facilitation repository)** is currently being prepared which will address the reform of Project Management from top-down planning to distributed peer facilitation and empowerment models. 

**B2) Project Management: QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process.** A QA assessment of how the Catalyst Funding Process can be reoriented from top-down planning to distributed peer facilitation and empowerment models is planned.

## C) Maturity-Models: The DAO Maturity-Model - Future Fund

**C1) DAO-Maturity-Model**: A repository adapting Quality Assurance Maturity-Models to distributed autonomous organisation (DAO) and which aims to progress DAOs to Institutional Audit Standards is currently being prepared. 

**C2) Maturity-Models: QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process.** A QA assessment of where the Catalyst Funding Process fits in the Blockchain Maturity Model and whether Catalyst can progress DAOs to Institutional Audit Standards is planned.

The content of the proposal on Ideascale will be released as a Word Document in PDF format and attached to this page.
Also linked at the following repository location : https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal/blob/main/Project-Catalyst/Documents/01-Ideascale-Proposal-Finalise-Stage.md

### (2) Self-Assessment checklist - QA and Completion - Due : Released

This deliverable is specified by Project Catalyst.
https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal/issues/95

**Self-Assessment checklist Summary :** How my proposal impacts the challenge metrics is articulated in this manner ;

**Did we manage to make it easier for developers to build on top of Cardano?**

I hope to highlight in Output (3) the Open-Source Assessment Report that an improved awareness of the wide range of the open-source Cardano community may enable developers to build from many different even contrary directions.

**Number of repos on Github using the tooling. (Month over month increase).**

The tooling in this proposal, it's repo, is the proposal undone. It will offer to the community a deconstructed, dissected and resurrected F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal. Although not usable as a template, it is hoped it's bones may be picked over for many months to come as point of reference.

**A sense of community and conversations. Having people around to talk with.**

This proposal has already been circulated around the Catalyst open-source community in the form of it's open-source assessment component, provoking mixed reactions and conversations.

**How I address the challenge question.**

I addressed the challenge question "How can we create a positive developer experience that helps the developer focus on building successful apps?" by focusing on one instance of a development lifecycle ; how to take something broken to the community to fix.

**Definitions of Success.**

**3 Months** - The Proposal is funded, it's contribution is recognized, which provided an incentive to continue to Fund 7.

**6 Months** - The Proposal is used as a useful reference tool for other proposals.

**12 Months** - The Proposal is now redundant and regarded as a historical anomaly.

**Budget Requirements.** My Budget is broken into $5 for basic costs. The minting of an ADA Non-Fungible Token is pending negotiation for work in kind with NFT-DAO.
