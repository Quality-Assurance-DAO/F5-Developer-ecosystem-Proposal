## A) The Open-Source DAO. Fund 5.

**A1) DAO-Open Source.** The aim of the QA-DAO is to encourage collaboration and innovation across all open-source Catalyst Projects. The QA-DAO project started with a GitHub organization, the repository maintainer **Stephen Whitenstall** https://stephen-rowan.github.io/ seeks to work with open-source projects in the Catalyst community, to gain an understanding of their context and to extend their reach to collaborators in the wider open-source community. QA-DAO's approach is iterative, recording lessons learnt from the proposal process for the community and adopting improvements from constructive criticism where they apply to a broad base.

**A2) Catalyst Open Source - QA Assessment of Catalyst Proposal Process.**
QA-DAO has begun with an experimental assessment of the various open-source perspectives within this Catalyst Fund 5 Process. This contribution is **FeedbackChallenge : Open Source** : https://github.com/Quality-Assurance-DAO/F5-Developer-ecosystem-Proposal/issues/32 which will run during Fund 5's Refine and Finalise stages (to gather Issues on the Proposal Process itself) and then continue onto Fund 5's Review and Assess stages (to gather issues on the Review Process).

## B) Project Management: The DAO of Peer-Facilitation - Fund 7

**B1) DAO-Peer-Facilitation (a Distributed Peer Facilitation repository)** is currently being prepared which will address the reform of Project Management from top-down planning to distributed peer facilitation and empowerment models. 

**B2) Project Management: QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process.** A QA assessment of how the Catalyst Funding Process can be reoriented from top-down planning to distributed peer facilitation and empowerment models is planned.

## C) Maturity-Models: The DAO Maturity-Model - Future Fund

**C1) DAO-Maturity-Model**: A repository adapting Quality Assurance Maturity-Models to distributed autonomous organisation (DAO) and which aims to progress DAOs to Institutional Audit Standards is currently being prepared. 

**C2) Maturity-Models: QA Assessment of Catalyst Funding Process.** A QA assessment of where the Catalyst Funding Process fits in the Blockchain Maturity Model and whether Catalyst can progress DAOs to Institutional Audit Standards is planned.
